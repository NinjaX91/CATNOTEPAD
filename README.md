## CATNotepad is based on the Original Project Android Notepad by MoMah. 
You can find his original project on https://github.com/MohMah/android-notepad.
His notes include the following: A simple note taking app for android inspired by Google Keep.
Following the approach of a simple note taking, i wanted to create an app that include the same concept of simple note taking. However use it as sample to integrate the following:
1. Microsoft Azure Authentication SDK.
2. Microsoft Intune SDK.
3. Microsoft Graph Integration.

Current Intune SDK: 7.6.0
Current MSAL Library: 2.0.12
Current MS Graph Library: 1.5.0

Main Example is SplashScreen, this will perform the Single Authentication.
App Registered on Test Tenant and Completed Test.
